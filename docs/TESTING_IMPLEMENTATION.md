- Auto-population features
- Form reset functionality
- Date handling and validation

## Testing Infrastructure

### Test Utilities (`src/test/utils.tsx`)
Custom helpers for consistent test setup:

- `renderWithProvider()`: Renders components with proper context
- `createMockTransaction()`: Generates realistic test data
- `addTransactionViaUI()`: Simulates complete user workflows

### Global Setup (`src/test/setup.ts`)
Environment configuration for reliable test execution:

- ResizeObserver mocking for chart components
- Global cleanup between tests
- Browser API polyfills

### Configuration (`vite.config.ts`)
Vitest integration with React and TypeScript:

```typescript
test: {
  globals: true,
  environment: 'jsdom',
  setupFiles: ['./src/test/setup.ts'],
  css: true,
}
```

## Package Scripts

```json
{
  "test": "vitest",
  "test:ui": "vitest --ui",
  "test:run": "vitest run"
}
```
