# Installments Feature - Implementation Complete ✅

**Feature:** Automatic installment transaction creation with flexible deletion options  
**Date:** December 6, 2025  
**Status:** Ready for Testing

---

## Overview

The installments feature allows users to create recurring transactions that automatically span multiple months. Each installment is created on the 1st of each month with a standardized description format.

### Key Features

✅ **Create Installments**
- Checkbox option in Add Transaction form
- Input for number of installments (2-36)
- Transactions created on 1st of each month
- Description format: `<Original Description> [1/6]`, `[2/6]`, etc.

✅ **Delete Installments**
- Three deletion options for installment transactions:
  1. **Delete only this installment** - Remove single transaction
  2. **Delete this and all future** - Remove from current onwards
  3. **Delete entire series** - Remove all installments in the group

✅ **Database Structure**
- UUID-based grouping (`installment_group_id`)
- Installment tracking (`installment_number`, `installment_total`)
- Indexed queries for performance
- Constraint validation for data consistency

---

## Implementation Details

### 1. Database Schema

**File:** `supabase/migrations/20251206_add_installments.sql`

Three new columns added to `transactions` table:
- `installment_group_id` (UUID) - Links all transactions in a series
- `installment_number` (INT) - Current installment (1-based)
- `installment_total` (INT) - Total number of installments

**Important:** All three fields must be NULL together or have values together (enforced by check constraint).

### 2. Service Layer

**File:** `src/services/supabaseDataService.ts`

New functions:
- `addInstallmentTransactions(transaction, count)` - Creates N installments
- `deleteInstallmentGroup(groupId)` - Deletes entire series
- `deleteFutureInstallments(groupId, fromNumber)` - Deletes from number onwards
- `getInstallmentGroupTransactions(groupId)` - Fetches all in group

### 3. TypeScript Types

**File:** `src/types/index.ts`

Updated `Transaction` interface with optional fields:
```typescript
installment_group_id?: string;
installment_number?: number;
installment_total?: number;
```

### 4. UI Components

**AddTransaction.tsx**
- Checkbox: "Create as installments" with Calendar icon
- Number input: Appears when checkbox is checked (2-36 range)
- Validation: Ensures installment count is at least 2
- Form reset: Clears installment fields on submit/cancel

**EditTransactionModal.tsx**
- Detects if transaction is part of installment series
- Shows radio button options for deletion type
- Displays installment number (e.g., "3/6")
- Confirmation before deletion

### 5. Test Coverage ✅

**Unit Tests:** `tests/services/installments.test.ts` (14 tests)
- Transaction creation with installment fields
- Date calculation (1st of each month)
- Year rollover handling
- Family member preservation
- Delete operations (single, future, all)
- Fetch operations
- Edge cases (36 installments, income, empty description)

**Integration Tests:** `tests/integration/suites/06-installments.integration.test.ts`
- Full workflow testing with real Supabase
- Multiple installment series
- Deletion scenarios
- Data integrity verification
- Multi-user household scenarios

## User Workflow

### Creating Installments

1. Open **Add Transaction** form
2. Fill in transaction details (amount, category, etc.)
3. Check **"Create as installments"** checkbox
4. Enter number of installments in the inline input (e.g., 6)
5. Click **Submit**

**Example:** Enter total amount $300 for 6 installments

**Result:** 6 transactions created at $50 each:
- `Gym Membership [1/6]` - $50 - January 1st
- `Gym Membership [2/6]` - $50 - February 1st
- `Gym Membership [3/6]` - $50 - March 1st
- ... and so on

**Note:** The amount entered is the **total cost**, automatically divided equally across all installments.

### Deleting Installments

1. Click on an installment transaction to edit
2. Click **Delete** button
3. Choose deletion option:
   - **Single:** Deletes only this one (e.g., February)
   - **Future:** Deletes February onwards (Feb, Mar, Apr...)
   - **All:** Deletes entire series (Jan-Jun)
4. Click **Confirm Delete**

## Database Migration Required 🚨

**Before testing, you must run the SQL migration:**

1. Open Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Copy contents from `supabase/migrations/20251206_add_installments.sql`
4. Paste into SQL editor
5. Click **Run**

**Verification:**
```sql
-- Check columns exist
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'transactions' 
AND column_name LIKE 'installment%';

-- Should return:
-- installment_group_id | uuid
-- installment_number   | integer
-- installment_total    | integer
```

## Testing Checklist

### Basic Creation
- [ ] Create 3-installment series
- [ ] Verify 3 transactions appear in list
- [ ] Check dates are 1st of each month
- [ ] Verify description format `[1/3]`, `[2/3]`, `[3/3]`
- [ ] Confirm all have same `installment_group_id`

### Deletion - Single
- [ ] Delete middle installment (e.g., 2/3)
- [ ] Verify only that one is removed
- [ ] Verify 1/3 and 3/3 still exist

### Deletion - Future
- [ ] Create 6-installment series
- [ ] Delete installment 3/6 with "this and future" option
- [ ] Verify installments 3-6 are deleted
- [ ] Verify installments 1-2 remain

### Deletion - All
- [ ] Create 4-installment series
- [ ] Delete any installment with "entire series" option
- [ ] Verify all 4 installments are removed

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Try creating 1 installment (should fail validation)
- [ ] Create 36 installments (maximum)
- [ ] Create installments with different family members
- [ ] Create income installments (not just expenses)
- [ ] Edit an installment transaction (should work normally)

## Technical Notes

### Date Handling
- All installments use **1st of month** for consistent billing dates
- Starting month is determined from the date field in the form
- Subsequent months increment by 1 month each

### UUID Generation
- Each installment series gets a unique UUID
- Generated in `addInstallmentTransactions` function
- Uses `crypto.randomUUID()` for client-side generation

### Performance
- Index on `installment_group_id` for fast queries
- Batch insertion of installments in single transaction
- Filtered index (only non-null values)

### Context Integration
- `setTransactions` called after installment operations
- Ensures transaction list refreshes immediately
- No page reload required

## Files Modified

### Types
- ✅ `src/types/index.ts` (MODIFIED - added 3 optional fields)

### Services
- ✅ `src/services/supabaseDataService.ts` (MODIFIED - 4 new functions)

### Components
- ✅ `src/components/AddTransaction.tsx` (MODIFIED - UI + submit logic)
- ✅ `src/components/EditTransactionModal.tsx` (MODIFIED - deletion options)

## Known Limitations

1. **Cannot edit installment properties**: You can edit amount/category/etc., but cannot change installment count or split existing transaction into installments
2. **No partial deletion UI in main list**: Must open edit modal to see deletion options
3. **No visual indicator in transaction list**: Installments appear as regular transactions (description shows `[n/total]`)
4. **Cannot combine installments**: If you delete middle ones, remaining installments stay separate

---

## Future Enhancements (Out of Scope)

- Visual badge/icon for installment transactions in list
- Bulk edit all installments in a series
- Convert regular transaction to installments
- Skip specific months (e.g., skip August)
- Custom installment dates (not just 1st of month)
- Progress indicator showing completion status

---

## Troubleshooting

**Issue:** Installments not appearing in transaction list  
**Solution:** Check that `getTransactions()` in service maps the new fields

**Issue:** Delete options not showing  
**Solution:** Verify transaction has `installment_group_id` populated

**Issue:** "Column does not exist" error  
**Solution:** Run the migration SQL in Supabase dashboard

**Issue:** Can't create installments  
**Solution:** Ensure number input is >= 2

**Issue:** All installments deleted when choosing "single"  
**Solution:** Check radio button selection state before confirming
