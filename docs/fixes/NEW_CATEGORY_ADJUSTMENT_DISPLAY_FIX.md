# New Category Adjustment Display Fix

**Date:** October 28, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed  
**Issue:** Creating new category didn't show in "Next Month Adjustments" list

## Problem

When creating a new category via the "New Category" tab in Budget Adjustment Scheduler:
- Category was added to personal budget ✅
- Category would appear in next month's budget ✅
- **BUT** No adjustment was shown in the pending adjustments list ❌

This caused confusion because:
- User clicked "Create Category"
- Interface said "No adjustments scheduled for next month"
- User didn't see confirmation that something was scheduled

## Root Cause

The code was only calling `updatePersonalBudget.mutateAsync()` but not `scheduleAdjustment.mutateAsync()`.

**Before:**
```tsx
if (isCreatingNew) {
  // Add to personal budget
  await updatePersonalBudget.mutateAsync({
    budgetId: activeBudget.id,
    updates: { categories: updatedCategories },
  });

  // ❌ Missing: No adjustment scheduled!
}
```

The adjustment scheduler tracks **changes** for next month. Without an adjustment record, the UI correctly showed "No adjustments" even though the category would appear next month.

## Solution

After adding the category to the personal budget, **also schedule an adjustment**:

```tsx
if (isCreatingNew) {
  // 1. Add to personal budget
  await updatePersonalBudget.mutateAsync({
    budgetId: activeBudget.id,
    updates: { categories: updatedCategories },
  });

  // 2. Schedule adjustment for next month
  await scheduleAdjustment.mutateAsync({
    categoryName: categoryName,
    currentLimit: 0,        // Doesn't exist in current month
    newLimit: newLimitNum,  // Will have this limit next month
    reason: reason || `New category: ${categoryName}`,
  });
}
```

### Key Points

**currentLimit: 0**
- Represents that category doesn't exist in current month
- Shows as increase from $0 → $X

**newLimit: newLimitNum**
- The budget limit user entered
- Will be applied to next month

**reason: reason || `New category: ${categoryName}`**
- Uses user's reason if provided
- Otherwise auto-generates: "New category: Holiday Shopping"

## User Experience After Fix

**Before:**
```
1. Click "Create Category"
2. Enter "Holiday Shopping", $500
3. Click "Create Category"
4. See: "No adjustments scheduled for next month" ❌
5. Confusion: "Did it work?"
```

**After:**
```
1. Click "Create Category"  
2. Enter "Holiday Shopping", $500
3. Click "Create Category"
4. See adjustment card: ✅
   
   ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
   │ 📈 Holiday Shopping                  │
   │ $0.00 → $500.00 (+$500.00)          │
   │ "New category: Holiday Shopping"    │
   │                                  [X]│
   └─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Visual Feedback

The adjustment will display:
- **Icon**: 📈 TrendingUp (green) since it's an increase from $0
- **Change**: $0 → $500 (+$500)
- **Type**: "increase"
- **Reason**: User's reason or auto-generated
- **Cancellable**: X button to remove before next month

## Benefits

✅ **Immediate feedback**: User sees their new category listed  
✅ **Clear intent**: Shows category will be added next month  
✅ **Consistency**: Matches behavior of adjusting existing categories  
✅ **Transparency**: Full history of what will happen next month  
✅ **Cancellable**: Can remove before month starts if needed  

## Edge Cases Handled

1. **No reason provided**: Auto-generates "New category: [Name]"
2. **Reason provided**: Uses user's custom reason
3. **Multiple new categories**: Each gets its own adjustment
4. **Cancel adjustment**: Removes adjustment but keeps category in personal budget
5. **Duplicate name**: Prevented by validation before reaching this code

## Testing Verification

**Test Case 1: Create with Custom Reason**
- Create "Vacation" with $1000 and reason "Summer trip"
- Verify adjustment shows: "$0 → $1000 (+$1000)"
- Verify reason shows: "Summer trip"

**Test Case 2: Create without Reason**
- Create "Gifts" with $200 and no reason
- Verify adjustment shows: "$0 → $200 (+$200)"
- Verify reason shows: "New category: Gifts"

**Test Case 3: Cancel Adjustment**
- Create "Test" with $100
- Click X to cancel adjustment
- Verify adjustment removed
- Verify category still exists in personal budget

**Test Case 4: Multiple New Categories**
- Create "Category A" with $100
- Create "Category B" with $200
- Verify both show in adjustments list
- Verify different colors
- Verify both will appear next month

## Files Modified

- `src/components/BudgetAdjustmentScheduler.tsx` (Lines 72-99)

## Conclusion

This fix ensures that creating a new category provides immediate visual feedback through the adjustments list, making it clear that the category will be added to next month's budget. The adjustment record serves as both confirmation and a preview of what will happen when the new month starts.
